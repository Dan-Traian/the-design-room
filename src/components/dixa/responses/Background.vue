    <p class="">Whats my background?</p>

    <p class="">
      Graduating from KEA in Multimedia Design and technology, I had an internship at
      Superb as a digital content and social media creator. After 6 months, I continued my
      education with a Top Up in Web development.
    </p>
    <p class="">
      Midway to the top up, I got hired at Flyhjaelp, as a junior Full stack developer.
      Jumping into an already existing project, I slowly developed myself into a Laravel
      and Vue developer, focused more on the frontend part. The team I was part of had an
      amazing impact in my growth, slowly gaining more knowledge in testing, security
      integrations and backend servers.
    </p>
    <p class="">
      With my prior experience, I slowly took over the creative and design processes,
      becoming the lead designer in the team, which was a combined position with my still
      in place frontend developer responsibilities and tasks.
